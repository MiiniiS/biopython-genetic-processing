# Biopython Genetic Processing
This project demonstrates fundamental operations such as **complement generation**, **transcription**, and **translation** of nucleotide sequences.

## 🧬 Overview

This repository provides a clear and reproducible framework for working with DNA and RNA sequences in Python.  
It focuses on three essential molecular biology tasks:

1. **Complement and Reverse Complement**  
   - Generate the complement or reverse complement of a DNA sequence.  
2. **Transcription**  
   - Convert a DNA sequence into its corresponding RNA sequence.  
3. **Translation**  
   - Translate an mRNA sequence into a protein (amino acid chain) using the standard genetic code.

All functions are implemented using **Biopython**, making the code efficient, modular, and extensible for future genomic analysis.
